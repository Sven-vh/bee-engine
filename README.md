# bee-engine
Cross-platform game engine for both PC &amp; PS5.

Read more about it on my portfolio: https://www.svenvh.nl/article/Block-2A.html

## Demo Games
There are 3 projects included in this repo. Each of them is made with my own Engine API.

By default, when you run in Visual Studio, it opens the PaintGame demo. I recommend running in either ``ReleaseEditor`` or ``Release``.

You can switch demo game by right-clicking on a project and selecting "Set as startup project".

Available project demos are:
- Paint Game
- Application (Car Game)
- Maze Game

The ``bee`` project contains the actual engine that the demos use.

### Paint Game

A Splatoon-like demo to stress test my engine with lots of entities and particle effects.

### Car Game

The first demo I made with my engine. A very simple car controller to show I can have game logic.

### Maze Game

A basic 3D Depth-First-Search algorithm to generate 3D mazes. Not really to showcase anything, more just for fun.
